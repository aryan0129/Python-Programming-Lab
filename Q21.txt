Q21. Write a function in Python that takes a list of integers as a parameter and returns a dictionary whose keys are the list integers and whose values are "even" or "odd" depending on the number parity. 

Code:
dictParity = dict()
    for x in l:
        if x%2 == 0:
            dictParity[x] = 'Pair'
        else:
            dictParity[x] = 'Impair'
    print(dictParity)
