Q20. We cosider the following dictionary of length N containing the students names as keys and their score lists as key values:
d = {'student1': listNote1, 'students2': listNotes2, ..., 'studentN': listNoteN}
Write a Python program that transforms this dictionary by replacing the score lists with their averages.

Code:
def meanList (L):
  mean = 0 
  n = len (L)
  for x in L: 
    mean = x + mean 
    mean = mean/n 
  return mean
d = {'student1': [14, 16, 18], 'students2': [12, 15, 17], 'student3': [16, 16, 13]} 
d [key] = meanList(d [key])
print ("The new dictionary is d =", d)
